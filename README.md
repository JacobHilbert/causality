# causality

My aim here is to write a python package that takes a bunch of correlated folders and text files and turns them into:

1. A transitable webpage-like html structure via [markdown2](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2) and [regular expression](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/re.py) parsing.

2. A tree structure of cause-consecuence relations bewteen events.

And as extras:

1. 



This is a personal proyect.
